KPi Kluster is a small app that provides a large database of (Key) Performance Indicators (KPI). These KPIs come from many different fields like online retail, user experience, accounting, IT, transportation and many more.


## Origins

Some of the KPIs in the cluster are provided by me (the author Jan Seifert) collected from various sources like books and professional experience. These KPIs are taken from my the professional field I am active in, and that includes among others digital product management and user experience.

Some of the KPIs have been gathered from the [KPI library](http://www.kpilibrary.com/). For almost 10 years the KPI Library offered professionals a platform to share, search, and discuss KPIs. The collection now available for download is the result of a community effort. The platform behind it was the KPI Library. It was founded in 2007 by Mirror42. Mirror42 was acquired by ServiceNow in July 2013.

These data were extensively improved by the author. Over 2000 KPIs were merged or eliminated.

* Removal of duplicate indicators,
* Removal of indicators not complete enough to be understandable
* Spelling correction
* Removal of "lonely" tags that existed only once for clarity
* Combination of redundancies between KPIs for clarity
* Correction of empty fields

Despite all these efforts the library may still contain ambiguities, vagueness, and mistakes. It was not possible so far to fill all missing information.

Please note that you use KPi Kluster at your own risk.


## Working with KPIs

Looking up KPIs in a data base means that the function you want to improve has become a 'hygiene factor' of your business. You cannot excel in this area over your competitors. You cannot win anything by improving it ... but you will lose if you don't.

If you - however - need to track something to compete over, you need to find ways to differentiate yourself from your competitors. Which means: you need to differentiate your KPIs. Because - in general - if two organisations measure the same thing, they will end up doing the same thing.

If you want to find ways to be different, you can use a KPI data base as inspiration. But you will track and work your KPIs in very different ways.

If you have never worked intensively with numbers and KPIs, I can only recommend that you get some help. If you e.g. have never heard the terms 'spurious correlation' or 'scale level', I can only recommend that you get some help.
